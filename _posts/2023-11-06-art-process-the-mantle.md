This particular entry in the album portrait series merits discussion because of how difficult it was for me to actually complete. 

<!--more-->

I had initially tried to complete this entry with an inspiration of *Human* by Death, but I never liked it.  Here it (and the album that it's supposed to be inspired by) is:

[some image]

It felt like a copy of the Ghost Reveries album portrait I did, but with none of the charm that accompanied. 

I feel like the Ghost Reveries one works because its so dark and the subject jumps out, but the Human one just has the subject disappearing into the background. It didn't feel like it was a portrait, but an amalgamation of colors.

So, back to the drawing board I went. There was a decent number of albums I could've chosen from but many were mostly monochrome or had atrocious looking art (I will go on a tangent about this in a moment), so I ended up choosing one that was monochrome but the subject had a connection to. At least a connection that I was familiar with, I'm sure there were others that had a personal connection I could've used to drive my process.

Before I continue, though, I just want to call out *Slaughter of the Soul* by At The Gates. Look at this.

Literally ***why*** is the logo a goddamn bar with a standard sans serif font? AND WHY IS THERE PAPYRUS? I know hating on papyrus is a meme in graphic design circles, but please, papyrus is a sin in this context. This looks like it was made in microsoft powerpoint. Its a damn shame because the art beneath the war crimes is really cool and could've been better served by anything else (except maybe comic sans).

With the tangent out of the way, I decided on The Mantle by Agalloch. I also really enjoy this album, which was the secondary motivation for choosing it after the subject's personal connection to the album.

The personal connection to the album was the primary motivating factor behind the entire design of the drawing. In his own discussion of the album, the subject talks about a previous experience in a log cabin with his family. The guitar strumming immediately brings back memories of ponderosa pines and a feeling of wanderlust. I wanted to capture this in the background of the image, so I went with some pine trees (not quite ponderosa pines). However, I chose a pacific northwest leaning winter scene because this band is from Oregon and features a statue in Oregon on the cover.

There was a problem, though. I am awful at backgrounds, and I had only once drawn a tree before. Bear witness to me figuring out how the fuck trees work:

I was losing my mind trying to figure out these trees. They are probably the part of the drawing I spent the most time on, simply because I had to re-draw them several times. At some point I was at my wits end and sent this to one of my friends:

When the trees were finally done and my soul was set free and I moved on to drawing the subject. I had drawn two versions of the subject. One I immediately scrapped, then the second which I decided to go with. For the one I decided to go with I also had two different outfits:

I had asked one of my friends to pick the one he liked better and he chose the second. He identified (correctly) that it was more visually interesting. "But Elias," you say, "you went with the first one! What happened?" Great question, my friend. I decided to go with the puffer jacket version because it was more accurate to the subject. Kinda regret that one, but oh well.

For some fucking reason I decided shade the subject before working on the background? Guess I really just wanted to work on something that was easy (shading his hair).

The rest of the drawing came together in a blur, and I unfortunately don't have any screenshots I sent my friend to look through and piece together the reasoning for the rest of the decisions I made when drawing the background. I do have bits of me putting in the elk, since that's a large feature in the album and must be included in the drawing.

I was initially going to put snow on that elk but it ended up blending in too much with the snow on the trees and I was over it.

After the background was put in, I was finally fucking free. I slapped a monochrome filter on it because it felt necessary. I now only post the colored version because the monochrome version looks boring to me, but hey, whatever. It was done. I drew trees and went only slightly insane. Little wins.
