I swear, I don’t want to just review indie. In truth I can do whatever with this blog because a total of 15 people even know about it to begin with, but still, I’d like to focus on metal and metal-adjacent albums and artists. However, that’s not stopping me from waffling a bit on Hozier’s *Unreal Unearth* today.

I’m not a Hozier girlie. I’m not even a girl, which disqualifies me from the title on several levels. However, hear me out about *Unreal Unearth*.

<!--more-->

Hozier has a niche, and he operates within it well. If you want a melancholic Irish man to sing about heartbreak, love, and longing, Hozier’s your man. *Unreal Unearth* is not a significant departure from this niche in most aspects, but when he does depart its abysmal. Case in point, “Damage Gets Done” is probably the worst track on the album. Brandi Carlisle’s voice doesn’t meld well with Hozier’s voice, entirely drowning him out for most of the song. I am known to be biased toward deeper voices, but I can still appreciate a higher pitched voice when it’s alone or blending well with the deeper voices it’s accompanying. That is not what Brandi Carlisle is doing. I also just don’t like her voice, but that’s a personal preference thing. The song itself is rather standard Hozier fare, but a bit more bland and repetitive than other things offered on this album.

Much of the album is standard Hozier fare, so I don’t want to go into too much depth. This is a waffle, after all, all notions of formality or an attempt at a high quality review are gone. However, I do want to talk about “I, Carrion (Icarian),”  “Son of Nyx,” “To Someone from a Warm Climate,” and “Butchered Tongue.”

## I, Carrion (Icarian)

This song grew on me. I didn’t initially take to it due to its relatively stripped down guitar strumming instrumentation, but I was in the right mood one day and the bridge absolutely tugged on my heart a bit. These lines specifically:

> I do not have wings, love, I never will
> 
> Soarin' over a world you are carryin'
> 
> If these heights should bring my fall
> 
> Let me be your own
> 
> Icarian carrion 

The tale of icarus is simplistic and well known by most people, but I love it for its simplicity. Do not overestimate your ability, do not overexert yourself, do not extend yourself farther than you are able to comfortably sustain: all things important to keep in mind, especially for anxious people pleasers like myself. The song itself is talking about love, as many Hozier songs do, but specifically this one talks about Icarus still loving the person the song references while still falling to his death. This fate does not change Icarus’ love for that person.

> If I should fall on that day
> 
> I only pray, don't fall away from me

Unwavering devotion is a common Hozier lyric staple, and boy does he do it well.

## Son of Nyx

This song actually got me to listen to the album. It is beautifully lush in instrumentation, which plays very well into the haunting choral vocals accompanying Hozier's brief vocals. The most notable son of Nyx is Charon, which means that this song is likely drawing some inspiration from the river Styx. It is suitably desolate and haunting feeling, if that is the case. There is not a ton to dissect here due to the lack of lyrics, but I still adore it with all of my being.

## To Someone From A Warm Climate

God, this one makes me feel depressed and lonely near instantaneously.  Many of the exes I really cared about were from warmer climates. I dated only one of them in a cold climate, but the feeling of having someone to curl up to in the cold is something that is hard to rival.

> A joy hard learned in winter was the warming of the bed
> 
> You’d shake for minutes there and move your legs
> 
> Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within 
> 
> Let your breath heat the air until you feel it getting thin

The whole song is permeated with this simple appreciation of a lover adjusting to the cold of your own climate, watching them realize that warmth does not always come as quickly and easily as they are used to.

> In summer's heat, I learned to dread the comin' of the night
> 
> The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
> 
> You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
> 
> The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls

This verse then  immediately shows the opposite: the same person seeking out the cool of concrete during the heat. Later, Hozier expands that this person he’s singing about wasn’t getting what they wanted out of the relationship:

> And I wish I could say
> 
> That the river of my arms have found the ocean
> 
> I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
> 
> Christ, it's boilin' over

Given that this lover from a warmer climate wishes to find a cooling presence, like the concrete they so desperately sought out to “make [their] head go quiet,” the water of Hozier’s heart (his feelings for the lover) were too powerful and suffocating them.

## Butchered Tongue

Ah, a song about longing for a culture that is yours but still out of your reach. Forever a mood for people from cultures that are slowly dying or people that are denied access to their culture from a young age.

Hozier is naturally coming at this from an Irish perspective: Gaelic is dying out, and a lot of effort is being put in to keeping it alive.

> And as a young man blessed to pass so many road signs
> 
> And have my foreign ear made fresh again on each unlikely sound
> 
> But feel at home, hearin' a music that few still understand
> 
> A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground

Road signs in Ireland are written in Gaelic, so likely Hozier is mentioning that he is grateful that some effort is being made to preserve a part of his heritage that is almost lost to time. He likely also learned Gaelic after learning English, meaning that his ear is still foreign to what should have been his mother tongue. However, the music sung in what should’ve been his mother tongue is still comforting to him. The butchered tongue, referring to the very weakened state of Gaelic, is still around and being used despite the hardship that the language is facing.

> You may never know your fortune 
> 
> Until the distance has been shown between what is lost forever
> 
> And what can still be known

This line here is directly stating that you may not know how lucky you are to have access to your dying mother tongue and culture. Some cultures are better off than others: some have more that “can still be known” while many have very little left (a great distance between what can still be known and what is lost forever). It’s a beautiful nod to not feeling at home with the culture best aligned with your heritage but doing what you can with what is available.

## Wrap-up

Okay, that is much longer than a waffle. Oh well. Anyway, this album is not mind blowing by any means. Son of Nyx was a welcome addition to the Hozier formula, for sure. However, the lack of deviation from the Hozier formula doesn’t mean I don’t like it as much as I did his previous albums. It gets a solid 7/10 from me - on my RateYourMusic that’s listed as “good (enthusiastic).”
