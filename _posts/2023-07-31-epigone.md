The first album I'm going to ramble about is *Epigone* by Wilderun. I don't think I could overstate my love for this album, so I'm excited to have a place to write down all my love for it.

Wilderun was formed in Boston, Massachusetts. They, like many bands from the area, emerged from Berklee College of Music. They're primarily described as symphonic progressive metal, but their first two albums lean more folksy than their other albums. Since their formation in 2008, they've released a total of 4 albums, with their most recent being *Epigone*.

## Lyrics

Before I fully break out into talking this album's themes and lyrics, I want to take a step back to talk about it's name: *Epigone*. Epigone, when used charitably, refers to a follower or disciple of something or someone. When used uncharitably, it refers to an inferior imitator. I think the album's themes align with both, especially in the first few songs that seem to tell a story about the singer understanding the inherent divinity of existence, losing said divinity, and grappling with the gods that insist that he was never supposed to experience divinity. "Exhaler" specifically talks about the pure beauty of experiencing said divinity and the pain of losing it.


> The key was skin and bone  
> When the Earth was still my home  
> The fortune has been spent  
> And the secret has been...  
>
> Hidden, locked away  
> How could I lose  
> The greatest knowledge I ever knew  

The accompanying instrumental on "Exhaler" is simple, comforting, and delicate. Lots of usage of gentle strumming and some strings in the background makes things especially calming and intricate. In the second verse of the two above, things quiet down quite a lot - somewhat conveying the importance of the loss to the singer.

"Woolgatherer," the longest on the album, then touches on the effect of no longer having connection to this inherent divinity. The singer is listless, he doesn't know where to go. He believes he is no longer of use, and is tired of being sought after for answers he no longer has. The god, which is voiced by Evan's fantastic growl throughout these first few songs, states that the glimpse that the singer had was never meant to happen. Specifically, "[the god's] revelation's just a memory to nurse." The track then goes to allude that the woolgathering (daydreaming) that the singer is doing here is never going to line up to what he's previously experienced.

"Passenger" seems to mostly be talking about the gods of this world demonstrating that the pain and suffering of the real world is necessary for the average life to continue. Specifically the god(s) state that "[they] need this like fire needs the air." Having access to this divinity is dangerous. It's likened to a *tabula rasa*, a blank slate. It is a road that should not be taken because nobody knows what lies along (or at the end of) it. However, the singer here fights back. Note that the god's lyrics (the growled lyrics) are **bolded**.

> **All the hells and all the bliss revealed**  
> As a single god  
> **It won't help, yet to it you must kneel**  
> It began it's life as a partner  
> When it fed you tales of woe and wonder  
> It's depleted all its stores  
> Yet somehow it still remains  
>
> It still feigns its uses  
> Practical abuses  
> How mundane this healing  
> What are you achieving?  

The singer is implying that the god is just trying to keep itself "useful" to the singer. It is a poor imitation of the god it used to be. This is especially visible in the last few bits of lyrics to "Passenger."

> It gave you everything when this began  
> ...  
> But is it the origin, is it the start?  
> Or is it just a parasite sewn to your heart?  

At the very end, the chorus comes in to implore the non-divine to enjoy life as it is without having to tirelessly seek out ultimate meaning.

"Identifier" is mostly talking about the corruption the singer has inflicted upon the divine as a concept. I would normally keep going and analyze the whole album, but I think the first few songs are sufficient to talk about themes. I'm also getting a bit tired fussing over the lyrics.

Initially the story is aligned with a pure disciple in "Exhaler" - the singer revels in pure simplicity. However, when deprived of it in "Woolgatherer," the singer grapples with forever chasing that divinity and not getting anywhere remotely close to what he experienced previously. In "Passenger," the singer has fully reasoned that the god is no longer useful and has been simply trying to appear useful for an extended period of time. As a response, the singer decides to just live without the constraint of finding ultimate meaning. "Identifier" is him realizing that he is now poorly imitating the divine and is a corrupting force upon it. He has now become the poor imitation of the ideas of the divine, falling from the disciple of the divine he was in "Exhaler."

This is at least the vibe I get from an initial pass and deconstruction of the first few songs. I'd like to really spend time on this lyrical analysis sometime in the future, but most of my adoration of this album is not centered on its lyrics (as I will mention again later).

## Instrumental & Vocals

As I mentioned earlier with "Exhaler," the composition of the songs follow the conveyed themes pretty well. There is an inherent sense of scale and being confronted with something immense (like a god) in the orchestration. Wilderun is known for how grand their orchestration is, as far as I can tell, and *Epigone* is certainly no exception. Its rich, lighthearted, and sorrowful where necessary to support what's going on in the lyrics. The album's orchestration quiets down to make points and it makes them well.

It feels like there's a hard line between Identifier and the set of Distractions. Not just musically, but thematically - things become far more abstract and its harder to piece out where we're going after the transition that is "Ambition." "Ambition" itself is a bit jarring, but given its a transition track between these ideas, I don't expect it to be fully in line with the previous tracks. "Ambition" is haunting and genuinely feels like wading through a sea of nothingness; perfect for a song immediately following the singer realizing that he is corrupting that which he once loved.

As I have come to expect from Wilderun, the bass is excellently used throughout the album. There's a bit of "Passenger" where everything drops out of the center for the bass to really show off what it's been doing in the background the whole time and its one of my favorite things in the whole album.

I don't think I could expand more on Evan's vocals other than that they are hauntingly beautiful. His growl has only improved across the three previous albums and I think it suits the terrifying energy a god is supposed to have.

## More personal ramblings

Alright, now that I've gushed about the rest of it, I want to talk about what this specific album means to me personally. Do note that I mostly looked at the lyrics for this review, so a lot of my attachment to it is completely disconnected from the lyrical themes. This is also your warning I'm quite sentimental when it comes to music, so expect some really corny admissions here and there. They're all genuine, despite how corny they might read.

Wilderun was one of the first artists I was introduced to. The actual first was [Sumerlands](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sumerlands/3540416533) but Wilderun was given to me soon after. [Sonja](https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Sonja/3540471134) was as well, but honestly so much has been introduced to me in such a short amount of time I can't order those three well aside from "Sumerlands goes first." I was given them as a recommendation because they were coming into town, and the new friend that was recommending me all the metal thought I might be into them. They specifically recommended *Veil of Imagination*, the 2019 album. At this point we hadn't known each other longer than a few weeks, but ***damn*** did they ever hit the mark with that recommendation. 

Seeing Wilderun open for OK Goodnight was my first metal show ever. There is genuinely nothing more fitting in hindsight. Even though there was a couple talking right in front of us during Wilderun's whole set and it was ***ridiculously*** crowded in there, it fundamentally shifted my music taste permanently. They had played a few tracks off *Veil of Imagination* and *Sleep at the Edge of the Earth*, as one would expect, but they also played "Woolgatherer" live for the first time. I took my friend's recommendation and listened to Veil before going so I knew (and adored) a few songs of theirs already, but Woolgatherer struck a chord with me. After the show the new friend and I hung around the bar and we got a chance to talk to Evan for a bit. He was genuinely one of the most kind and approachable people I've ever met. I sadly don't remember much of the conversation (at least not bits I'd mention here), but I remember it being extremely easy for me to talk to him. I'm quite introverted, so that is no small feat.

A few days later I sat down to listen to *Epigone* and was enamored. It took on the feeling of the beginning of a new aspect of myself, a significant shift in the music I enjoy and a bit of who I am as a person. Every time I listen to it I am grateful for this shift. When my new friend and I had met each other I was coming off of a bad situation and wanted something new to explore, and he provided that effortlessly. I hadn't expected the new thing to be as life changing as being properly introduced to metal, but I am happy it was. My love for this album is as effortless as our friendship has been so far, and some bits of *Epigone* are going to be tied to my appreciation of that friendship and the doors it opened forever.

Alongside this tie to my friendship and a fresh start, the album is also paradoxically comforting and familiar. As a double bassist that primarily played in orchestras in grade school and beyond, the symphonic elements of this album (and Wilderun in general) ties the current version of myself with the best parts of my younger self. It feels like a smooth gradient, a blend of my current life and the parts of my childhood that I loved. This is only intensified by the fact that this album was not directly recommended to me, but something I chose to explore on my own.

The last thing I'll leave you with is one line of what I wrote in the middle of the night a few days ago while listening to *Distraction III*, the most sentimental aspect of this review yet and the reason I was motivated to write this whole thing:

> It's immense and beautiful, a true testament to the enormity of human feeling.
