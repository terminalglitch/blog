A quick preface to this review: **this is going to be more talking about a personal connection to a song than proper review**. This song has been very comforting to me the last 7-8 months, so I wanted to talk about it. Feel free to skip if you're not into reading someone talking about their feelings.

My love language is music. Sharing it, listening to it together, playing it together‚Ä¶ every aspect of music and how it can be shared is deeply emotional to me.

It also augments the way I process my emotions. No processing of blind rage is complete without listening to a grindcore album and no processing of pain is truly experienced without melancholic indie.

Today I bring you not an album, but a single from indie band Searows: *House Song*. I am a little ashamed to admit that I found Searows from *House Song* going viral on TikTok, but I am glad I found him at all. This song in particular has been instrumental in processing some of my own pain.

The gentle repeating phrase on the guitar serves to lull the listener at the beginning of the track and creates a dreamy vibe across the entire track. It especially lends well to the song‚Äôs subject: reminiscing upon the memories and ideas tied to old homes, how many simultaneous memories exist in a home, and complicated memories that one might have in their childhood home.

I especially love the mention of height markers on the walls and how inevitably a new one will be drawn and covered by the next family that inhabits the home. A new family will make memories in that home, but your feelings and memories of your childhood remain somewhere under all that paint. Alec continues with,

> Mark my words, there‚Äôs a thousand things that don‚Äôt wash out with anything
> 
> I keep you clean, you surrounded me
> 
> And my windows are breaking

This is a direct mention that some things, namely memories, don‚Äôt quite wash out from that home. The ‚Äúyou‚Äù mentioned here seems to be a previous version of the singer. He‚Äôs attempted to scrub out the memory of his childhood, but it remains and haunts him. The windows breaking here seem to be a release; he‚Äôs finally escaping the confines of his childhood bedroom to move onward.

This song personally connects with me as someone that has a lot of complicated feelings regarding their childhood. My parents made a lot of bad decisions while raising me, and that has permanently damaged my relationship with them. However, they did have their moments of trying to show genuine care. They have supported me playing bass since the very beginning. Last I was visiting my parents I heard my mom remark that she missed hearing me play bass while I was practicing in the next room over and it broke me. No child wants to be at odds with their parents, but there are certain factors that make it impossible for me to really be vulnerable with my parents. Hearing my mom make a supportive remark while I was not in the room was a reminder of what could‚Äôve been. I am more myself and consistently happier than I have ever been before, but it‚Äôs hard to not occasionally mourn what could‚Äôve been.

This song demonstrates those feelings eloquently through Alec‚Äôs beautiful voice and the gentle guitar backing. These feelings are something that trans people have survived before. I will eventually get through them too. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èü©µ
