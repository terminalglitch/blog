I thought I would be able to take a break from the *Epigone* lyrics after finishing off my [review]({% post_url 2023-07-31-epigone %}) of the album yesterday, but that was not the case.

In my initial review I talked about Exhaler, Woolgatherer, Passenger, and a little bit of Identifier. I'll kinda re-hash those, talk about the songs I haven't covered yet, and pull them all in to talk about how they connect with the concept of epigone.
